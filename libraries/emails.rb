    body << "<p>Tip: as you decide which scenarios to access, please be aware that our scenarios get progressively more complex/difficult as the number of the scenario increases.

    body << "<p>Should you decide you want access to <b>all 47</b> of the scenarios within two weeks of your original purchase date, you may upgrade your Starter Package to our Full Package for the price difference of $154. (This would equal the same price as if you had ordered the Full Package originally.)</p>"
    body << "<p>Note this is in contrast to the pricing of ordering additional scenarios after the two week period has passed, when the upgrade package(s) cost $95.00 per set of 12 scenarios (for a total of $285 for access to all 36 of the scenarios once the two weeks is up) plus an additional $70 to purchase the 10 Exam Scenarios, which is included in our Full Package.
